# Face_Recognition_System

This prototype performs real-time face detection and recognition. It detects and captures images of an user from live videos using Haar Cascade classifier and Python computer vision libaries. It then processes the images and stores them in a folder with a specific ID for each user. The Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm is trained with the dataset of facial images captured for face recognition. The model is then stored on disk and tested to identify faces. It detects the users face captured using the system's camera and displays the user's name or a 'None' label based on whether it is trained with the user's face or not. A customised GUI is also created and integrated to the python scripts for taking samples, storing names and IDs, traning and testing.
